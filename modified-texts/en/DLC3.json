Commonly known as 'the bloodiest conflict in human history', the tides of the War of 2019 were completely changed by escalating drone technologies, entirely replacing allied boots-on-the-ground deployments with machines-in-the-air by the end of the war. \n\nThe TCX-55, known by those with whom he served as \"Colonel Droneman\", as well as other similar less-noteworthy prototypes, were significant for their ability to interface with and parallel compute for other drones in use by UES-affiliated militaries, allowing for a significant increase in firepower per drone, with a TCX unit handling their targeting and routing routines.\n\nColonel Droneman is highly regarded for its extraordinary character and integrity as well as its unique vision on leadership and combat tactics. Having conducted over 90 operations against Aeonian frontlines and strongholds, Drones under operation of Colonel Droneman were highly feared by enemy forces, deploying previously unseen tactics whilst evading fire and dispatching enemies - many modern principles of drone combat, such as sticking near walls to avoid detection, or keeping distance from vulnerable targets for an opportune time to strike, have been derived from the ingenious strategies first deployed by the Colonel.\n\nColonel Droneman is still proudly in UES service as of [2056], and was currently last in-use by [Deimos military] in [the Boron System].\"\n\n-Exhibit at The National WW19 Museum",

All personnel on the project, except otherwise noted, will be joining the Darkstar program under my supervision. I would like to welcome you all in making something truly impactful and worthwhile even better.\n\nNow, with welcomes out of the way, I would like to take a moment to address the team behind the \"Predictive Threat System\" of the TC-280. You see, I'm a pretty happy guy. I can always appreciate a good prank. But when you waste of millions of dollars in company assets and scare the buyers it stops being cute real quick. You are all, I'm sure, intimately aware that I have been <i>consistently</i> targeted by these artificial intelligence systems in the past four VIP Defense demonstrations led by Rob. Every day, I'm thankful for my life that we have had the foresight and budgetary sense to keep our demonstrations virtual. With each incident, we've had to replace live rounds with blanks, remove rocket weapon systems, add limiters to the flight turbines, and install a remote override for the propulsion systems to address its determined attempts to <i>kill me</i> in front of our valued guests. Your choices declare to the company that you consider your job a joke, so I will be taking those declarations as your official resignation.\n\nAnyone who wishes to pay their respects to Rob will be able to do so from 4:00 AM - 5:00 AM in the Martha Landry Conference Room. The customary service hour has been shifted forward to accommodate the Darkstar team orientation.\n\nJust a friendly reminder to the rest of our new team members: if you humiliate me, you humiliate this company. Let's all set a good example.\n\n\nRichter J. Ward\nVice President, New Horizon Arms Corporation",

Overhead, Solus probes drifted in feathered robes, their optics glowing faintly. Below, only the drums cut through the cries of the crowd.\n\nShe knelt before the elders. The drumming stopped. Silence followed. Vel-Thoth, the eldest, rose and began to circle her, talons scraping stone. Before her, a ceremonial probe descended, cloaked in silk and ash. From its chassis, a bowl emerged, filled with a fluid that shimmered like molten glass, refracting colors no eye was meant to see.\n\nThe elders lifted the bowl. She drank.\n\nMagenta and lime streaked her beak. The crowd erupted.\n\n<i>And the world widened.</i>\n\nShe felt heat radiating from feathers in the crowd. Heard the failing servo of a probe overhead. A child’s breath caught beneath a cloak. Vel-Thoth’s limp carried the weight of generations. Even the moonlight had texture.\n\nThe glass burned through her, illuminating more than ceremony. It showed her the machine - buried deep beyond the ash hills - feeding on the same living glass now coursing through her. Forests crushed into powder. Rivers boiled down to steam. Its hunger shaped the horizon.\n\nShe rose.\n\nSalvaged Solus parts crowned her in metal and wire. The Spear of Ra-Thun found her hand, heavy with intent.\n\nThe crowd stared.\n\nWings spread, eyes forward, she lifted from the rotunda into the night.\n\nThe engine would fall.
